At that time, the patient did not report any complaints or concerns. Upon reviewing the patient's chart, I noted that the most recent Depression Assessment form on file dates back to 2021. As a result, on March 25, 2025, I sent the patient a new Depression Assessment form to complete in order to keep the medical record current. To further ensure the patient's documentation is up to date, I will also send out a Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) form. All other aspects of the patient's care and preventative screenings are current. The patient's next scheduled office visit is on May 12, 2025.\n",

The chart does not indicate whether the patient had any specific complaints during that visit or if they had been compliant with prior treatment instructions. I reviewed the patient's chart thoroughly to check for any missing laboratory tests, procedures, or routine health screenings. It was noted that the patient is currently due for updated Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and Depression screening forms. To address this, I sent the necessary links to the patient so they can complete the forms and ensure the chart is up to date. During the last office visit, the patient had lab work completed and is currently up to date with both prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and colorectal cancer screenings.\n",

The patient’s medication list was reviewed and is accurate. All current prescriptions reflect the patient’s active health conditions, and no discrepancies or outdated medications were noted. The patient is up to date on all other routine maintenance health screenings, including cervical, colorectal, and metabolic assessments, as appropriate for age and clinical history. The provider has been monitoring tachycardia at each visit as a consistent point of concern. To further evaluate these episodes, an ambulatory cardiovascular telemetry monitor was ordered on 04/04/2025. This device will continuously track the patient’s heart rhythm for up to 30 days, allowing for detailed analysis and interpretation by a physician. Results will be used to determine if further cardiology intervention is necessary.\n\n",

She is alert, oriented, and demonstrates stable mobility without any recent history of falls or balance-related concerns. Her age, current physical condition, and functional independence indicate a low risk for falls according to standard assessment guidelines.\"\nSDOH: The Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) information for the patient’s (PT) has not been updated since 2023. Additionally, there is currently no reliable or functional contact number available to send the necessary forms for the PT provider to complete. This lack of up-to-date contact information has made it difficult to ensure the appropriate forms are received and processed in a timely manner.\nDepression Screening: The patient (PT) scored a 6 on the depression screening conducted on 9/18/2024, which may indicate mild depressive symptoms. Since that initial assessment, the patient has not completed an updated screening. Attempts to follow up have been unsuccessful, as there is currently no reliable or working phone number available to send the screening form for the patient to complete. As a result, further evaluation and monitoring of the patient’s mental health status have been delayed.\n\n\n\nCare Management Summary:\nThe patient (PT) was last seen on September 18, 2024, for a Comprehensive Wellness Exam (CWE). At the time of the office visit (OV), the patient was asymptomatic and reported feeling well, with minimal to no complaints. Upon reviewing the patient's medical chart, I noted several missed appointments, outstanding lab work, and pending procedures. The chart also documents a history of substance use, including both drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nThe patient is currently due for multiple follow-up appointments, including a CWE, Disease Management Office Visit (DZM OV), Chronic Care Management Office Visit, and all major laboratory tests. Additionally, the patient is overdue for a Women’s Health Visit (WHV), PAP smear, Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) assessment, as well as depression, alcohol, and drug screenings.\n\nEfforts have been made to contact the patient in order to schedule the necessary appointments and send out the required forms. However, communication has been unsuccessful due to the lack of a valid or functioning phone number on file.",

A standardized SDOH form was sent to the patient for completion in order to update and complete the chart accordingly.\nDepression Screening: The patient has not completed a depression screening since September 2023. At that time, the patient scored a 7 on the PHQ-9, indicating mild depression. The chart notes a diagnosis related to grief, with an associated ICD code, following the loss of the patient's father in a fire one year prior to that office visit. The patient denied suicidal ideation and expressed interest in pursuing therapy. The provider referred the patient to Behavioral Medicine (Psychologist) via Epic for further support and treatment.\n\nCare Management Summary: \n\nI reviewed the patient's chart and noted that the patient has not been seen in the clinic since December 2024. I have made efforts to contact the patient to schedule a follow-up appointment; however, I have not received a response at this time. The patient is currently due for several important assessments and screenings, including the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and Depression screening—relevant forms were sent to the patient on March 28, 2025. In addition, the patient is also due for all necessary blood work, a Pap smear, a Women's Health Visit (WHV), A1C and a Comprehensive Wellness Exam (CWE).",

As of today's date, there has been no response from the patient regarding the message or confirmation that the form has been completed. The patient's chart remains Un updated pending the return of the completed form.\n\nCare Management Summary:\nThe patient’s last office visit (OV) was on December 6, 2025. During that visit, the patient was seen for a Chronic Disease Management (CDM) appointment. The conditions addressed included hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and an enlarged thyroid. It was noted that the patient had not been compliant with the treatment and lifestyle instructions previously provided by the physician.\n\nUpon reviewing the patient's chart, it was determined that the following items are currently due: a depression screening (last sent out on March 28, 2025), a Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) form (to be sent out), all necessary labs and diagnostic tests, a comprehensive wellness exam (CWE), and a follow-up appointment. These items are essential for the continued monitoring and effective management of the patient’s chronic conditions.\n",

During that visit, the patient reported experiencing shoulder pain. Throughout the course of treatment, the patient has remained compliant with all medical instructions and recommendations provided. I conducted a thorough review of the patient's chart to identify any missing appointments, screenings, laboratory tests, or procedures. Upon review, it was noted that the patient is due for both the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and Depression screenings. A secure link was sent to the patient to complete these screenings, which will be used to update the medical record accordingly. At this time, the patient is current with Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) testing, colon cancer screenings, and routine laboratory work. The patient’s next office visit is scheduled for May 5, 2025.\n\n\n",

Given her age, current level of mobility, and absence of any recent history of falls or conditions that typically increase fall risk—such as impaired balance, use of assistive devices, or cognitive deficits—she is not considered to be at significant risk for falls at this time.\n\nSDOH: The patient has not updated their Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) information since 2024. On March 27, 2025, the patient was contacted and asked to complete the necessary surveys in order to update their chart. However, as of now, the patient has not responded or submitted the completed forms.\n\nDepression Screening: \nOn March 27, 2025, I sent the patient a link to complete a depression screening form, as the previous screening on file has not been updated since 2024. As of today, the patient has not acknowledged receiving the form, nor have they completed or submitted it. A follow-up may be necessary to ensure the screening is completed in a timely manner.\n\nCare Management Summary:\nThe patient's last office visit (OV) was on October 23, 2024, during which they were seen for a DZM visit. At that time, the patient reported symptoms related to allergies and asthma. They had been compliant with treatment recommendations and instructions provided during the visit. I have thoroughly reviewed the patient’s chart to assess for any missed appointments, outstanding labs, or incomplete procedures. Based on the review, the patient is due for a follow-up visit, Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) screening, depression screening, and all necessary labs and tests. Additionally, the patient is due for a Comprehensive Wellness Exam (CWE), a Pap smear, and a Women’s Health Visit (WHV). Prior attempts have been made to contact the patient in order to schedule these appointments and update their chart accordingly. However, as of now, the patient has not responded to these outreach efforts.\n\n",

Based on her age, overall physical condition, and current medical evaluation, she is considered to be at low risk for falls. Therefore, a formal fall risk assessment is not indicated or required as part of her current care plan.\n\nSDOH: The patient has not had their Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) information updated in the chart since 2018. It is important to ensure that this information is current to provide comprehensive and personalized care. An outreach to the patient will be made to gather updated details and appropriately document them in the medical record.\nDepression Screening: The patient has not completed an updated depression screening since March 4, 2024. As part of routine mental health monitoring, it is important to ensure these screenings are kept current. We will reach out to the patient to complete the updated screening at their earliest convenience.\n\nCare Management Summary:\nThe patient was last seen on December 3, 2024, for a DZM office visit, during which she presented with concerns related to menstrual irregularities. She reported that the issue had been ongoing for several days and noted a pattern of irregular menstrual cycles. Upon reviewing the patient’s chart, I assessed for any missed appointments, outstanding procedures, or overdue screenings. Given that the patient has not been seen since the December visit, she is currently due for Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and depression screenings, routine laboratory tests, a women’s health visit (WHV), a comprehensive wellness exam (CWE), and a Pap smear. I have made outreach attempts to schedule a follow-up appointment; however, the patient has not responded or scheduled a visit since the last encounter.",

Since the patient has not had any visits since December 2024, they are now due for all recommended labs, the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) assessment, and the Depression screening forms, which will be sent to the patient. Additionally, the patient is due for their Comprehensive Wellness Exam (CWE), Pap smear, and colorectal cancer screening.\n\nI have made attempts to contact the patient in order to schedule a follow-up appointment; however, I have not yet received a response.\n\n",

There are concerns that medication adherence may be suboptimal, as the patient has not consistently followed the prescribed regimen. The patient is currently overdue for a follow-up appointment, which is necessary to evaluate treatment progress, address adherence concerns, and reassess the care plan.\nA sleep study has been ordered to assess for possible underlying sleep disturbances, which may be contributing to anxiety symptoms. Additionally, the patient is due for both an exercise stress test and a 2D echocardiogram as part of their routine cardiac workup. \n",

This classification places her in the category of severe obesity, indicating a significant deviation from the recommended weight range for her developmental stage. Her condition suggests a long-standing history of excessive weight gain beginning in early childhood, which may be associated with various contributing factors, including genetics, lifestyle habits, diet, physical activity levels, and possible metabolic or hormonal imbalances. Early intervention and continued monitoring are important to reduce the risk of associated health complications such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, joint problems, and psychosocial issues related to body image and self-esteem.\nAsthma or severe allergies - On October 10, 2023, the patient’s chart indicated a history of seasonal allergies. However, during the most recent office visit on April 8, 2025, it was documented that the patient had no known allergies. This discrepancy suggests that the patient’s allergy status may have changed, or that previous documentation may need to be reviewed for accuracy. It is recommended to clarify this information with the patient to ensure the medical record reflects the most current and accurate allergy status.\nCongenital heart defects - N/A\nCystic Fibrosis -N/A\nEpilepsy or seizure disorders - N/A\n\nDevelopmental and Behavioral Disorders \nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) - N/A\nAttention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) N/A\nIntellectual or learning disabilities - N/A\n\nComplex Medical Needs\nPremature birth complications - N/A\nGenetic disorders (e.g. Cerebral Palsy) - N/A\nChildren requiring ventilators, feeding tubes, or other medical devices - N/A\n\nMental Health Challenges\nAnxiety, depression, or mood disorder - N/A\nPost Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) - N/A\nEating Disorder - N/A\nSelf-harm or suicidal tendencies - N/A\n\nRehabilitation and Therapy Needs \nPhysical, occupational, or speech therapy - N/A\nRecovery from major surgeries or injuries - N/A\nSubstance use disorder treatment - N/A\n\nCoordination of Multiple Specialists\nPatient seeing multiple providers (e.g. neurologists, endocrinologists, psychiatrists) - N/A\nComplex medication management - PT is on basic medications \n\n\n",
